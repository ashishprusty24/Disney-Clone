- The Sliding Part: The sliding category part in the homepage is built on Transform CSS property.
- Sign Up and Sign In: The Sign in and Sign up part are built on Position Absolute CSS Property and could not have been easier if not for this property.
- Transition Part: The transitioned elements after the sliding part is built by using this property.
